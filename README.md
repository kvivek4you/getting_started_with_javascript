# Getting Started With JavaScript 
#### _By a newbie, for the newbies._

## Why this book?
There are plenty of awesome tutorials and books on the internet that promises to help you get started with JavaScript. I neither claim to be at par with them, nor do I intend to. I wrote this book for two reasons:
  - I wanted to express my understanding of the basics of programming and JavaScript. While I wrote this book, I kept in mind the confusion and frustration faced by the newbies. The writing reflects my personal struggle to overcome them. I hope my empathy towards my fellow learners will strike the right chord.
  - My technical mentor wanted me to write such a piece as my first assignment.

## Coverage
The material in this book is _skin deep_. The intended audience are people with absolutely _no programming experience_, except familiarity with the basics of the web like HTML and CSS. If you are an experienced programmer who wants to learn JavaScript, you will be disappointed by the lack of coverage.  

## Approach
The material is presented using a _bottom-up_ approach - the core concepts of programming are prioritized over the JavaScript syntax. Programming is presented as the main activity, and JavaScript as a tool to express your thoughts. In fact, the best way to learn programming is to practice language-agnostic thinking. An advantage of this approach is that you can transfer the same concepts when you use other programming languages.

## How to read this book?
This book is meant to be read sequentially, as each chapter depends on the foundation of the preceding chapters. That said, experienced readers can jump back and forth between the chapters, since the chapters are reasonably self-contained. If you are a beginner, I _strongly recommend going through the chapters sequentially_. Please engage actively when you read this book - think about the concepts presented, doodle them, write a few lines of code to verify your idea. Never read any technical material passively like you would read a novel.

Also, please __don't ignore the questions I ask you to think about, and the exercises that I ask you to do__. They reinforce the concepts while you learn. They served me good, and I hope they will be helpful for you too!
